## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start

**Problem**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`
**Solution**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the backend folder

**Problem**: `Address already in use`
**Solution**: Port 8000 is busy. Kill the process or change PORT in `.env`

### Frontend shows connection error

**Problem**: "Failed to connect to server"
**Solution**:
1. Check backend is running (terminal shows "Uvicorn running")
2. Try accessing http://localhost:8000 directly - should show JSON message
3. Clear browser cache and reload

### Can't see other players online

**Problem**: Two players logged in but can't see each other
**Solution**:
1. Make sure both are authenticated (check browser console for "Authenticated" message)
2. Refresh the page
3. Check backend terminal for connection logs

### Bot doesn't move

**Problem**: Made a move but bot doesn't respond
**Solution**: Check backend terminal for errors. The bot should move automatically after your move.

### Game board not updating

**Problem**: Made a move but board doesn't update
**Solution**: Check browser console (F12) for errors. Make sure Socket.IO connection is active.
